# UnitySaveScript

A collection of classes and interfaces to help with saving and loading of persistent data (saves) in Unity. The resulting save file is compressed using System.IO.Compression's default ZipFile class and can be opened by any .zip viewer. Feel free to add third party libraries for more fine-tuning of the compressed save files, and feel free to use the scripts in your projects
